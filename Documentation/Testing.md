# Testing
Nummi organizes its testing code into multiple subprojects classified by their position in the testing pyramid.
This is so we can be selective in the tests we want to run. 
For example, the faster Unit Tests can be ran first in a build pipeline for quick feedback before running the slower Integration Tests.
